# Strong-Password-Generator
A small project in designing and implementing a password generator. 

The general idea is to create a 16 character password generator that creates random secure passwords from capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.
I'm gonna start by simply putting all of these characters into an array or file and writing a simple main to generate a password randomly from the array or file. This could though create issues with too few numbers or letters being used in a password and I'll have to refine the code to fix that. But for now the goal is to make a proof of concept.
