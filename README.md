# Strong-Password-Generator
A small project in designing and implementing an unsecure password generator. 

The general idea is to create a 16 character password generator that creates random UNSECURE passwords from capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

This generator is unsecure and served mainly as a way for me to research PRNG and better forms of RNG. I'll be making a more secure generator on python with some form of salting to add another layer of security
